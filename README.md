# Getting started with Text-utils

This project was bootstrapped with the React Library from Facebook. This project is the first project I have made using the React framework. This react-app basically capitalizes the first letter of your name.

# Features

This react application can perform the following features :
1. Capitalize any input to upperCase.
2. Convert any input to lowerCase.
3. Your Text Summary.
4. Preview the input.
